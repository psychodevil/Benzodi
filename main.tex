	\begin{abstract}
		Benzodiazepines are a class of psychoactive drugs that interact with the \emph{GABA$_A$} receptors. They consist of a typical structure of benzene ring attached to a diazepine ring. The different drugs differ in the substituents that are attached to the benzodiazepine core. We summarize the properties of three of drugs of the benzodiazepine  family: Chlordiazepoxide, diazepam ,and lorazepam. We report on their discovery, mechanism of action, site of action, pharmacokinetic properties, metabolites, active metabolites, side-effects, toxicity, as well as dosage forms.
